# Tic-Tac-Toi
A simple Game
Hello Every one, Today I am going to show you how to make a simple Tic Tac Toe game with Python programming language.
## **The Plan**

## **Our** Tic Tac Toe game **has to do the following:**

- Create the display window for our game.
- Draw the grid on the canvas where we will play Tic Tac Toe.
- Draw the status bar below the canvas to show which player’s turn is it and who wins the game.
- When someone wins the game or the game is a draw then we reset the game.

## Now you can start thinking about how this might work in code. The code will need to do the following:

- Initializing game components
- Initializing Pygame window
- Load and transform images
- Define the functions
- Run the game forever
